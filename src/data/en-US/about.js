That’s why Deus is just as committed to the art and culture that inform language—the stories as told by native speakers—as it is to skill-building course tools.",
    "about_text1": "Deus (DAY-əs) takes its name from the Latin phrase deus ex machina, or the moment in a story when everything turns around for the better. By connecting learners to original art by native speakers, we create conversation-changing moments…a shift in the language-learning journey that turns it all around."
